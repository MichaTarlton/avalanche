% --- Goodness of fit (Clauset et al. 2009, sec 4.1, Appendix D)
% Synthetic datasets are generated by sampling the hypothesized power-law
% distribution. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance between the real and
% synthetic datasets are compared, and the p-value is computed as the
% fraction of synthetic distances that are larger than the empirical
% distance. Power-law distribution rejected if p â‰¤ 0.1 for N = 1000
% synthetic observations.
%
% Synthetic datasets are created using the method of transformation from
% random numbers r drawn from a uniform distribution on [0, 1) based on the
% method in Appendix D of Clauset et al. (2009). (see synthGen function)
